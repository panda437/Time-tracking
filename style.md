# Asif Akbar's Writing Style Guide

## Voice & Tone

**Direct and conversational** - Write like you're talking to a friend, not writing a corporate memo. Avoid fluff and filler words.

**Approachable with dry humor** - Use sarcasm and wit to keep readers engaged, but don't overdo it. The goal is to be human, not a comedian.

**Clear over clever** - Prioritize clarity and impact over showing off vocabulary. Simple words often work better than complex ones.

## Structure & Flow

**Well-organized but not rigid** - Ideas should flow logically, but don't force textbook-style outlines. Let the content guide the structure.

**Use concrete examples** - Instead of abstract concepts, give readers specific, relatable examples they can picture.

**Sharp observations** - Include insights that make readers think "oh yeah, that's totally right."

**Punchy one-liners** - Use short, memorable sentences to drive home key points.

## Language & Phrasing

**Avoid generic corporate speak** - No "in today's digital age," "leverage," "synergy," or other buzzwords.

**Use "you" throughout** - Make it personal and direct. Write as if you're having a conversation.

**Imperfect is okay** - Don't over-polish. Natural, human writing is better than perfect but sterile prose.

**Short sentences work** - Break up long sentences. Make points quickly and clearly.

## Examples of Good Style

### ✅ Good:
- "You know that feeling when you're supposed to be working, but instead you're three hours deep into a Twitter thread about the latest global crisis?"
- "Your brain is basically a negativity sponge."
- "Set a timer. Your brain will fight you on this, but you're the boss of your brain, not the other way around."

### ❌ Avoid:
- "In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape..."
- "Leverage these strategies to optimize your productivity outcomes..."
- "It is imperative that one considers the implications of..."

## Content Guidelines

**Start with a hook** - Grab attention immediately with a relatable scenario or observation.

**Use real examples** - Reference specific platforms, situations, or behaviors people actually experience.

**Be honest about problems** - Don't sugarcoat issues, but offer practical solutions.

**End with actionable takeaways** - Give readers something concrete they can do right now.

## Remember

The goal is **clarity and impact**, not showing off vocabulary. Write like you're explaining something to a smart friend who's busy and doesn't have time for bullshit.
